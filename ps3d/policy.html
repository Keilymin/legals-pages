    <p><strong>Last updated May 08, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <div class="note">
        <p>This Privacy Notice for OwlForge Studio ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," <strong>or</strong> "<strong>our</strong>"), describes how and why we might access, collect, store, use, and/or share ("<strong>process</strong>") your personal information when you use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>"), including when you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download and use our mobile application (Paint Space 3D), or any other application of ours that links to this Privacy Notice</li>
            <li>Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Questions or concerns?</strong> Reading this Privacy Notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. We define the purposes and means of processing your personal information. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:owlforge.studio@gmail.com">owlforge.studio@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="1-what-information-do-we-collect-">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us in the course of using our Services or when you contact us. We collect limited personal data that is either automatically generated through your use of the game or provided by third-party services (such as analytics or advertising). This may include information about your device type, approximate location (based on IP), and in-game interactions.</p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
    <p><strong>Google Account Data.</strong> If you choose to sign in with your Google account, we receive only the basic profile information you authorize (e.g., user ID, name, email address).</p>
    <p><strong>Support &amp; Feedback.</strong> If you contact us via email, social media, or any other channel, you voluntarily provide your name (or username), contact information (e.g., email address), and message content.</p>
    
    <h3>1.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <p>We <em>do not</em> collect precise location (GPS). Instead, the following data is gathered by third-party SDKs integrated into our app:</p>
    <p><strong>Device &amp; Usage Data.</strong> Device model, operating system and version, device identifiers (e.g., Device ID), app version, session duration, crash reports, and feature usage.</p>
    <p><strong>Approximate Location (IP-Based).</strong> General geographic area (city/country) derived from your IP address.</p>
    <p><strong>Push Notification Token.</strong> We use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver push notifications. When you enable notifications, FCM generates a unique device token on its servers and provides it to the app. We receive this token solely to send you game-related notifications; we do not store it on our own servers or link it to any personal identifier. You can opt out at any time by disabling notifications in your device's settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Analytics &amp; Crashlytics.</strong> Google Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics collect performance and usage metrics to help us improve the game.</p>
    <p><strong>Advertising Data.</strong> Unity Ads may process device information and your IP-based location to deliver personalized ads.</p>
    
    <div class="note">
        <p><em>We do not store these raw or identifiable data points; they are processed and retained by Google and Unity under their own Privacy Policies. For a better understanding, we recommend reading their privacy policies.</em></p>
        <p>For more details, please see:<br>
        • Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a><br>

        • Unity Privacy Policy: <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy</a></p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>1.3 Payment Data</h3>
    <p><strong>In-App Purchases.</strong> Any real-money transactions are handled exclusively through Google Play Billing. We do not receive or store your payment card details or billing information. All payment data is handled and stored by Google.</p>
    <p>For more details, please see Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    
    <h3>1.4 Sensitive Information</h3>
    <p><strong>None Collected.</strong> We do not process special categories of personal data (e.g., health, religious beliefs, biometrics).</p>
    
    <h3>1.5 Aggregated and Anonymous Data</h3>
    <p>We may collect, analyze, store, and share aggregated or anonymized information, such as statistical or demographic data, for any lawful purpose. Once aggregated or anonymized, this information cannot be used to identify any individual user by any reasonably available means.</p>
    <p>Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. For details, please see: <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy</a></p>
    
    <h3>1.6 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>We do not store personal data on our own servers. Instead, retention is determined by our third-party service providers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Analytics (including Firebase Analytics).</strong> User-level and event-level data are retained for up to 14 months.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics.</strong> Crash and error reports are retained for 90 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging.</strong> Messages are retained up to 28 days. Device tokens are retained until they are explicitly revoked or become inactive, in accordance with Firebase's policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services.</strong> Data is stored for as long as the user account exists or until the user deletes the data as described in Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing.</strong> Transaction and subscription records are retained in your Google account as described in Google's Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity Ads:</strong> Data is retained by Unity for up to 12 months.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After these periods, data is automatically deleted by the provider and is no longer accessible to us.</p>

    <h2 id="5-controls-for-do-not-track-features">5. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
