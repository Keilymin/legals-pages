    <h3 id="2-1-sign-in-via-google-play-games">2.1. Sign-In via Google Play Games</h3>
    <p>When you sign in via Google Play Games, your game progress <strong>may</strong> sync across devices. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Synced:</strong> number of diamonds, unlocked textures, scenes and other.</li>
        <li><strong>Not Synced:</strong> completed scenes and scenes "in progress" remain only on the device where they were started or completed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We <strong>do not guarantee</strong> precise data synchronization across devices, especially if multiple devices are used simultaneously or the internet connection is unstable. We <strong>do not guarantee</strong> that data will not be lost and are not responsible for any loss of data.</p>
    
    <h3 id="2-2-guest-mode">2.2. Guest Mode</h3>
